# Creating a Branch in GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop and navigate to your repository.
2. Click on the "Current Branch" dropdown in the top middle of the window.
3. Click on "New Branch."
4. Enter a name for your branch (e.g., `new-feature`) and click "Create Branch."
5. You are now on your new branch and can make changes without affecting the main branch.
6. After making changes, you can commit them to this branch and push the branch to GitHub when you're ready.

**Note:** Branch names should be descriptive and use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `fix-typo`, `add-feature-x`). Try to keep branch names concise and relevant to the changes being made. Usually, when you working with a team, it's a good idea to create a new branch for each issue or feature you're working on. This keeps your work organized and makes it easier to manage changes.
