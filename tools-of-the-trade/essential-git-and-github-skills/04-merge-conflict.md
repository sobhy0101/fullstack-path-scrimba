# Merge Conflicts in GitHub Desktop

## What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when two branches or developers have changes on the same file that cannot be automatically merged by Git. This typically happens when:

- Two branches/developers modify the same line in a file.
- One branch deletes a file that the other branch modifies.
