# JavaScript Fundamentals - Section 03

Welcome to the JavaScript Fundamentals section of the Scrimba Fullstack Developer Path! This section builds upon the HTML and CSS foundation with interactive JavaScript programming.

## 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

Through this section, I mastered:

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Variables, data types, operators, and control structures
- **DOM Manipulation**: Selecting elements, event handling, and dynamic content updates
- **Interactive Programming**: Building responsive user interfaces and applications
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable code solutions
- **Modern JavaScript**: ES6+ features and best practices

## 🚀 **Projects & Applications**

### Core Learning Projects

- **Interactive Applications**: Dynamic web applications with user interaction
- **DOM Practice**: Hands-on exercises manipulating webpage elements
- **Event Handling**: Projects focused on user input and browser events
- **Problem-Solving Exercises**: Coding challenges to strengthen logic skills

### Practice Area (`practice/`)

The practice folder contains additional exercises and experiments:

- **Apps**: Complete applications demonstrating different concepts
- **Exams**: Coding challenges and assessments
- **Playground**: Experimental code and learning exercises

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern syntax and features
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and DOM elements
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout for interactive elements
- **Browser APIs**: Working with the Document Object Model
