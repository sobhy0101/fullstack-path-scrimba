# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a **learning documentation repository** for the Scrimba Fullstack Path course. It tracks progress through a comprehensive fullstack development curriculum that covers frontend, backend, fullstack integration, and AI engineering.

## Repository Architecture

### Learning-First Structure
- **Topic-based organization**: Content is structured by course modules (e.g., `tools-of-the-trade/`, upcoming `frontend/`, `backend/`, `fullstack/`, `ai-engineering/`)
- **Progressive documentation**: Each module contains notes, code samples, challenge solutions, and personal reflections
- **Portfolio building**: Projects are documented for job application readiness

### Expected Directory Pattern
```
{topic-area}/
├── {lesson-area}/
│   ├── {concept}.md          # Learning notes
│   ├── challenges/           # Interactive coding solutions
│   ├── projects/             # Portfolio projects
│   └── screenshots/          # Visual documentation
```

## Key Development Context

### Technology Stack Progression
- **Frontend**: JavaScript → TypeScript → React → UI/UX → Responsive Design
- **Backend**: Node.js → Express → SQL → API Development  
- **Fullstack**: Next.js → Integration → Testing → Deployment
- **AI Engineering**: OpenAI APIs → Embeddings → Vector Databases → AI Agents → LangChain.js
- **Tools**: Tailwind CSS → Firebase → Git/GitHub → Vercel

### Documentation Patterns
- **Learning reinforcement**: Each lesson includes personal reflections and concept summaries
- **Code examples**: Practical implementations with explanatory comments
- **Challenge solutions**: Step-by-step problem-solving documentation
- **Project documentation**: Portfolio-ready descriptions with deployment details

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### When Adding Content
- **Follow topic-based structure**: Create directories matching course progression
- **Include learning context**: Add explanatory comments and concept summaries
- **Document decision-making**: Explain "why" behind implementation choices
- **Reference course materials**: Link back to Scrimba lessons when relevant

### File Creation Patterns
- Use `.md` files for notes and documentation
- Include practical code examples with explanations
- Add screenshots and visual aids to `screenshots/` subdirectories
- Create `challenges/` subdirectories for practice problems

### Portfolio Preparation
- Document projects with deployment links and technology explanations
- Include both technical implementation and learning outcomes
- Prepare README files that showcase skills to potential employers
- Maintain clean, professional code with educational comments
