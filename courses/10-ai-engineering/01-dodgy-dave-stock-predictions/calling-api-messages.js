 * Challenge:

 * I've pasted some output below. Try and figure out 
 * what instructions I gave OpenAI to get that output.
 * 
 * On the screen, visions gleam, a tech queen's dream, 
 * in every home's scene.
 * Pixels dance, in a trance, shows advance, in a 
 * high-def glance.
 * Remote in hand, worlds expand, from sitcom land to 
 * news that's grand.
 * Binging shows, the excitement grows, the plot thickens 
 * and the time just flows.
 * From dawn till night, in colors bright, TVs light up 
 * our life just right.
