/*

Choosing a chunk size:
- Depends on the type of content: short content vs. large documents

- Consider the embedding model and its token limits

- User queries: short and specific vs. longer and more detailed

- Consider how you'll use the retrieved results

*/

/* The output will be an array of documents, where each document is a chunk of the original text. Each chunk will have a maximum of 150 characters, and there will be an overlap of 15 characters between consecutive chunks. This means that the last 15 characters of one chunk will be the first 15 characters of the next chunk, ensuring that important context is preserved across chunks. The output will be logged to the console for review or down here:
