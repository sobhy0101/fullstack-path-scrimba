                <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours 
                    and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned. 
                    That would have been great if those projects actually helped me learn what 
                    I was trying to learn. But in reality, I wasn't spending enough time figuring 
                    out how to integrate different concepts together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thankfully, I was able to learn an alternative approach to learning. 
                    Instead of coding all day, I started spending just 30 minutes a day 
                    on projects, and the rest of my time I would spend actively practicing 
                    what I learned through building small components and refactoring code.
                </p>

                <h2>How I got started</h2>
                <p>
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning plan. I would decide on 
                    a single concept to focus on each day - maybe Grid layouts, or Flexbox 
                    alignment, or responsive images. Then I'd build something small that 
                    specifically used that concept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The breakthrough for me was documenting everything in this learning journal. 
                    By teaching others what I'm learning, I solidify my own understanding. 
                    Plus, it's a great way to build a portfolio that shows my growth as a developer.
                </p>

                <h2>The power of community</h2>
                <p>
                    Joining the Scrimba Bootcamp has been transformative. Getting feedback from 
                    experienced developers and connecting with fellow learners has accelerated 
                    my progress in ways I never imagined. We review each other's code, share 
                    tips, and celebrate wins together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're on the fence about joining a bootcamp or learning community, 
                    my advice is simple: do it. The accountability and support system is worth 
                    its weight in gold.
