  7. JavaScript Fundamentals → ../../03-javascript-fundamentals/
  8. X Clone & Essential JS → ../../07-essential-javaScript/03-build-an-x-clone/
  9. Git/GitHub Tools → ../../04-tools-of-the-trade/
- **Profile Image**: `images/my-profile-photo.webp` (configured)
- **Article Images**: Unsplash placeholders (working, can be customized later)
- **Icons**: Logo (logo.svg), Favicon (favicon.svg), Hamburger menu (create SVG)

### Key Requirements from README

- CSS Grid for layout
- Flexbox for posts/articles
- Viewport meta tag
- Open Graph + Twitter meta tags
- Alt attributes on images
- CSS reset/normalize
- External CSS file: `css/style.css`
- Comments explaining structure and styling

### Stretch Goals (for later phases)
- Custom content about student's learning journey
- "View More" JavaScript functionality (hide/show posts)
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- Animations/transitions
- CSS variables
- Additional pages (contact, portfolio links)

## Code Style Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Code must look human-written, not AI-generated

### Writing Style
- Use varied comment styles (some detailed, some brief, occasional typos)
- Natural variable/class naming (not overly systematic)
- Mix of coding patterns (not perfectly consistent)
- Occasional learning-oriented comments ("trying grid here", "learned this from Kevin Powell")
- Some CSS properties in different orders
- Mix of single and double quotes occasionally
- Real-world naming (not generic placeholder1, placeholder2)

### Student Context
- Learning responsive design from Scrimba course
- Instructors: Kevin Powell (CSS), Per Borgen, others
- Building portfolio project for job applications
- Will share with Discord learning community
- Should demonstrate understanding, not perfection

- `.copilot-instructions.md` - AI assistant context
- `PROJECT-LOG.md` - Personal development notes
- `learning journal - scrimba transcript.txt` - Course transcripts
- `*.zip` - Archive files
- Development artifacts and caches

### Files Visible on GitHub:
- All HTML, CSS, JS files

- Design reference files (optional)

## 🔄 Current Phase: Phase 3 - Testing & Validation

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] "View More" button functionality
- [ ] All 9 blog post links working
- [ ] Navigation between pages
- [ ] Header/footer loading correctly
- [ ] Images loading properly
- [ ] CSS animations working
- [ ] Accessibility features functional
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Known Issues to Check:
- Verify all relative paths work when deployed

- Check hero article overlay on desktop

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (✅ COMPLETE)

- Add responsive layouts with media queries
- Create authentic blog content
- Link to real projects

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (🔄 IN PROGRESS)
- Test responsive behavior
- Validate HTML/CSS
- Check accessibility
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance check

### Phase 4: Polish & Launch (⏳ UPCOMING)
- Final code review
- Documentation updates
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Share with community

## Student Preferences
- Uses "--" prefix for answering questions (clear and efficient)
- Prefers detailed explanations when pausing for review
- Wants natural-looking code for peer/instructor review
- Open to suggestions and questions
- Has unstable internet/electricity (save progress frequently)
- PC, internet, and electricity can be unreliable (Dec 13-14, 2025 issues)

## Important Notes for AI Assistant

### Working with Dev Server:
- **Student runs the server locally** (already running since morning)
- **AI cannot see rendered frontend** - only code
- **Testing workflow**: Student views in browser → reports back → AI helps debug
- **Avoid asking to restart server** if already running (can cause conflicts)

### Communication:
- Be patient with connection interruptions
- Save context in this file before making major changes
- Provide complete solutions to minimize back-and-forth
- Focus on human-like code patterns

## If Connection Lost
Resume from Phase 3 - Testing & Validation. Check `PROJECT-LOG.md` and recent file modifications to determine exact progress. Student will describe what testing revealed.
