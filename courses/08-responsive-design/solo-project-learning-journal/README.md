# Solo Project - Learning Journal Website or Blog

## Overview

You are going to build a wonderfully designed learning journal website or blog. This site has three pages that you'll need to build from scratch using HTML and CSS.

First, we have the homepage, which would look like this on small and larger screens. The homepage features a top article or post and a list of recent posts below. Then we have a page displaying the full article along with its related image, and below the article, a list of recent posts, and finally, there's an about me page displaying your image, greeting, and bio, which will be below that is a list of recent posts.

You can view the designs for each page on small and larger screens here:

- [Article Page Design](https://www.figma.com/file/YourFigmaLinkHere)
- [About Me Page Design](https://www.figma.com/file/YourFigmaLinkHere)

**Notice** Each page has a header displaying the site logo 'images/logo.svg' and name 'Sobhy Learning Journal', and a small navigation with home and about me links to start. Each page also has a footer at the very bottom.

## Basic Requirements

- Build each page from "scratch"
- Make all pages responsive
- Separate header and footer for all pages
- Use relative units for font sizes, margins, paddings, and other measurements (em, rem, %, vh, vw)
- Use mobile-first design
- Use media queries to adjust the layout for larger screens
- Use CSS Grid for layout and positioning
- Use Flexbox for articles and posts
- Use Google Fonts for typography (Roboto and Merriweather)
- Include the viewport meta tag
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Use external CSS file 'css/style.css' for styling

## Stretch Goals

- Make it your own!
- Add custom images (Customize the images and content to be all about your learning experiences.)
- Make the content about your learning experiences
- Add more pages (contact information, links to your portfolio, resume, and other materials that will help you in your job search)
- Display other recent posts after clicking "View More" (a bit of JavaScript to hide all but six of your recent posts on the homepage, then displaying the other posts when the user clicks the view more link.)
- Responsive navigation displaying a “hamburger menu" on smaller screens
- Add animations and transitions
- Use CSS variables for colors, fonts, spaces and other design elements
