# Solo Project: Food Ordering App

## Overview

In this solo project, you will create a simple food ordering application using JavaScript. The app will allow users to browse a 3-item menu, select items to add to their order, and view the total cost of their order and remove items.

## Requirements

1. **Menu Display**: Create a menu with 3 food items. Each item should have a name, description, and price.
2. **Add to Order**: Allow users to add items to their order by clicking on them. When an item is added, it should appear in the order summary.
3. **Order Summary**: Display the items in the order summary along with their individual prices.
4. **Total Cost**: Calculate and display the total cost of the items in the order summary.
5. **Remove Items**: Allow users to remove items from their order summary. When an item is removed, the total cost should update accordingly.
6. **User Interface**: Create a simple and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.

## Bonus Features (Optional)

- **Quantity Selection**: Allow users to select the quantity of each item they want to order.
- **Persistent Order**: Use local storage to save the order so that it persists even if the page is refreshed.
- **Responsive Design**: Make the app responsive so it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Checkout Process**: Implement a simple checkout process where users can review their order before finalizing it. Mock payment processing can be included as a pop up.
- **Modal offer**: Add a modal that appears when the user adds an item to the order, offering additional options and while updating the current total.

## Submission

Once you have completed the project, submit your code by pushing it to a GitHub repository and sharing the link with your instructor. Make sure to include a README file that explains how to run your application and any additional features you implemented.

Note: Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. This will make the project more manageable and help you stay organized. Also, please retain from using a semi-colon (;) in your JavaScript code as part of the project constraints.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to reach out to your instructor. Good luck to us both and happy coding!
