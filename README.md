# Scrimba Fullstack Path Documentation

## Built for the Real World

The Scrimba Fullstack Path is designed to equip you with the practical skills and knowledge needed to become a job-ready fullstack developer.
The curriculum is based on extensive industry research into what new hires actually need to succeed in today’s job market. You’ll gain a well-rounded, modern skill set that spans both frontend and backend development—from building beautiful interfaces to creating fast, scalable APIs.

## What I'll Learn

I’ll begin by mastering the fundamentals of frontend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. From there, I’ll progress into fullstack territory by learning how to build backend servers and APIs with Node.js and Express.js, manage data and authentication with SQL and Supabase, and build production-ready fullstack apps using Next.js.

I’ll also use TypeScript to write safer, more scalable code, and learn how to test my applications to ensure reliability. To future-proof my skills, I’ll get a crash course on AI engineering, teaching me how to build AI-powered and agentic apps.

## Projects & Practice

Throughout the path, I’ll build over a dozen portfolio projects and solve 100s of interactive coding challenges that reinforce my learning—while helping me stand out to employers.

## Learn at Your Own Pace

The path is fully self-paced, so I can choose whether I'd like to do it part-time or full-time.

## Overview

This repository contains notes, code samples, screenshots, scripts and projects from the Scrimba Fullstack Path course. The path covers front-end and back-end development using modern technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and Next.js.
