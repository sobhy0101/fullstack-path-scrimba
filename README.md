# Scrimba Fullstack Path Documentation

[![Fullstack Path â€” Scrimba](images/github-social-preview-comp.png)](https://github.com/sobhy0101/fullstack-path-scrimba)

A curated learning diary of the Scrimba Fullstack Path â€” hands-on notes and projects across frontend, backend, and AI engineering.

## Built for the Real World

The Scrimba Fullstack Path is designed to equip you with the practical skills and knowledge needed to become a job-ready fullstack developer.
The curriculum is based on extensive industry research into what new hires actually need to succeed in todayâ€™s job market. Youâ€™ll gain a well-rounded, modern skill set that spans both frontend and backend developmentâ€”from building beautiful interfaces to creating fast, scalable APIs.

## What I'll Learn

Iâ€™ll begin by mastering the fundamentals of frontend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. From there, Iâ€™ll progress into fullstack territory by learning how to build backend servers and APIs with Node.js and Express.js, manage data and authentication with SQL and Supabase, and build production-ready fullstack apps using Next.js.

Iâ€™ll also use TypeScript to write safer, more scalable code, and learn how to test my applications to ensure reliability. To future-proof my skills, Iâ€™ll get a crash course on AI engineering, teaching me how to build AI-powered and agentic apps.

## Projects & Practice

Throughout the path, Iâ€™ll build over a dozen portfolio projects and solve 100s of interactive coding challenges that reinforce my learningâ€”while helping me stand out to employers.

## Learn at Your Own Pace

The path is fully self-paced, so I can choose whether I'd like to do it part-time or full-time.

## Overview

This repository contains notes, code samples, screenshots, scripts and projects from the Scrimba Fullstack Path course. The path covers front-end and back-end development using modern technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, SQL, and Next.js.
