# Rename, Copy, and Move Files

In this section, we will explore how to rename, copy, and move files using command-line tools. These operations are fundamental for managing files and directories in any operating system.

## Rename Files

To rename a file, you can use the `mv` command. The basic syntax is:

```bash
mv [old_filename] [new_filename]
```

## Copy Files

To copy a file, you can also use the `cp` command. The basic syntax is:

```bash
cp [source] [destination]
```

## Move Files

To move a file (or rename it), you can use the `mv` command as well. The basic syntax is the same as for renaming:

```bash
mv [source] [destination]
```

## Why Does `mv` Handle Both Rename and Move?

The `mv` command is used for both renaming and moving files because, at the filesystem level, both actions simply change the file's path:

- **Renaming** changes the file's name within the same directory.
- **Moving** changes the file's location to a different directory (the name can stay the same or change).

Both operations update the file's directory entryâ€”so the system treats them the same! After either command, the file's path is updated.
