# Alternative Text

Alternative text (alt text) is a brief description of an image that is added to the HTML code using the `alt` attribute. It serves several important purposes in web accessibility:

1. **Screen Reader Support**: Alt text provides a textual alternative for screen readers, allowing visually impaired users to understand the content and function of images.

2. **Contextual Information**: It conveys essential information about the image, including its purpose and meaning, which may not be apparent from the image alone.

3. **SEO Benefits**: Search engines use alt text to index images, improving the visibility of web content in search results.

4. **Fallback Content**: If an image fails to load, the alt text is displayed in its place, ensuring that users still receive relevant information.

## Best Practices for Writing Alt Text

- **Be Descriptive**: Provide a clear and concise description of the image content. Include important details that convey the image's purpose.

- **Keep It Short**: Aim for brevity while still being informative. A few words or a short sentence is usually sufficient.

- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don’t include phrases like "image of" or "picture of." Screen readers already announce images as such.

- **Use Keywords Wisely**: If applicable, include relevant keywords for SEO, but avoid keyword stuffing.

- **Consider Context**: Tailor the alt text to the context in which the image is used. What information is most important for users in that specific context?
- **Decorative Images**: If an image is purely decorative and does not add meaningful content, use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate that it can be ignored by screen readers or added via CSS by using:

```css
background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg'); /* Use CSS for decorative images */
background-size: cover; /* Ensures the image covers the whole section */
    background-position: center; /* Centers the image in the section */
```

## Examples of Good Alt Text

- **Informative**: "A group of students studying in a library."
- **Functional**: "Submit button for the contact form."
- **Decorative**: If an image is purely decorative and adds no informational value, use an empty alt attribute (alt="") to indicate this to screen readers.

## Avoid These Common Mistakes

- Don’t use alt text that is too long or overly detailed.
- Avoid vague descriptions like "image" or "photo."
- If an image has a label or adjacent text, do not repeat it in the alt text.
- Avoid using file names or generic phrases like "image1.jpg" or "photo."
- Do not use alt text to stuff keywords for SEO purposes.

## Tools for Checking Alt Text

- Use browser extensions like **axe DevTools** or **WAVE** to identify images without alt text and evaluate the quality of existing alt text.
- Incorporate accessibility checks into your design and development workflow to ensure all images have appropriate alt text.
- Regularly review and update alt text as needed, especially when images or their context change.
